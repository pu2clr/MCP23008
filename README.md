# [PU2CLR - MCP23008 Arduino Library](https://pu2clr.github.io/MCP23008/)

It is an Arduino Library to control the MCP23008 8-Bit I/O Expander. 

The MCP23008 device provides 8-bit, general purpose, parallel I/O expansion. It can be controlled via I²C bus applications. It is a great and inexpensive device that allow you to add more peripherals to be controlled by your Arduino board via I²C protocol.

Some Arduino projects may require more pins than the Arduino actually has. In these cases, you can use up to 8 MCP23008 devices using only the I²C bus (two Arduino pins) and add up to 64 input / output ports to your project. 


This Arduino library implements the most important functions available on MCP23008 device  and can be freely distributed using the MIT Free Software model.

## Basic schematic

The image below shows a basic MCP23008 application with LED. You can control up to 8 LEDs. The I²C bus address is set to 0x20. You can select another I²C address by dealing with the A0,A1 and A2 pins (from 0x20 to 0x27). This circuit uses the MCP23008 GPIO PINs as output.   

### GPIO as output setup

![Basic Schematic with LEDs](extras/images/basic_schematic_output.png)


#### Arduino setup suggestion

```cpp
#include <pu2clr_mcp23008.h>

MCP mcp;

void setup() {
  mcp.setup(0x20, 0); // I²C Address 0x20 and all GPIO pins configured to output
```

You also can use the methos setRegister as shown below (See MCP23008 IODIR register)

```cpp
    mcp.setRegister(REG_IODIR, 0B00000000);    // Sets  all GPIO pins to output
```

#### Output setup example

```cpp
#include <pu2clr_mcp23008.h>

MCP mcp;

void setup() {
    mcp.setup(0x20,0);   // I²C address 0x20; All GPIO port/pin are configured as output
}

void loop() {
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    {
        mcp.turnGpioOn(i); // Turns the GPIO / port i on
        delay(200);
        mcp.turnGpioOff(i); // Turns the GPIO / port i off
        delay(200);
    }
    delay(2000);
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    {
        mcp.turnGpioOn(i); // Turns the GPIO / port i on
        delay(300);
    }
    delay(2000);
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    {
        mcp.turnGpioOff(i); // Turns the GPIO / port i off
        delay(300);
    }
    delay(2000);
}
```


### GPIO as input setup


![Basic Schematic with LEDs](extras/images/basic_schematic_input.png)


#### Arduino setup suggestion

```cpp
void setup() {
  mcp.setup(0x20, 0B11111111); // I²C Address 0x20 and all GPIO pins configured to input
```

You also can use the methos setRegister as shown below (See MCP23008 IODIR register)

```cpp
    mcp.setRegister(REG_IODIR, 0B11111111);    // Sets  all GPIO pins to input
```


### GPIO as input and output setup


![Basic Schematic with LEDs](extras/images/basic_schematic_io.png)


```cpp
#include <pu2clr_mcp23008.h>

MCP mcp;

void setup() {
  mcp.setup(0x20, 0B00001111); // I²C Address 0x20, GPIO 0-3 are inputs and  4-7 are outputs
```

You also can use the methos setRegister as shown below (See MCP23008 IODIR register)

```cpp
    mcp.setRegister(REG_IODIR, 0B00001111);    // Sets  GPIO pins 0-3 to input and  GPIO pins 4-7 to output
```

#### [See input/output sketch example](https://github.com/pu2clr/MCP23008/tree/main/examples/mcp_poc_03_input_output) 



## Prototype 

The prototype below is based on the GPIO as input and output setup schematic

![Basic prototype based on input / output schematic](extras/images/mcp_input_output1.png)



## Internal Interrupt setup

The MCP23008 device has internal interrupt support. That means you can know instantly when a GPIO configured as input changed its status (from high to low or from low to high). This library implements some functions to support MCP23008 internal interrupts. You also can configure the internal interrupt behaviour. See the [MCP23008 library API for more details](https://pu2clr.github.io/MCP23008/extras/apidoc/html/).  See also [the examples mcp_poc_interrupt01 ans mcp_poc_interrupt01](examples/). 

The code below shows how to setup internal interrupt on given GPIO pin. Observe the MCP23008 internal pullup configured before configuring the interrupt. In this setup, the gpio.

It is important to know: __only  pins  configured  as  inputs  can  cause  interrupts. Pins configured as outputs have no affect on INT. After an interrupt is triggered, you can not deal with other interrupt until GPIO or INTCAP registers is read. Only reading GPIO or INTCAP registers  will clean the interrupt status and will make a new interrupt possible__. 


```cpp

  mcp.pullUpGpioOn(MCP_GPIO1);          // Enables internal pullup resistor on gpio pin 1
  mcp.pullUpGpioOn(MCP_GPIO3);          // Enables internal pullup resistor on gpio pin 3
  
  mcp.setInterrupt(INTERRUPT_INTPOL_ACTIVE_HIGH, INTERRUPT_ODR_OPEN_DRAIN); // Defines the behaviour of the interrupt

  // GPIO pin 1 setup
  mcp.interruptGpioOn(MCP_GPIO1, HIGH); // Sets the GPIO pin 1 to deal with interrupt. The pin 1 will be compared with the value 1 (HIGH). It will be launch an interrupt if the pin 1 goes to level 0 (LOW).

  // GPIO pin 5 setup
  mcp.interruptGpioOn(MCP_GPIO3, HIGH); // Sets the GPIO pin 3 to deal with interrupt. The pin 3 will be compared with the value 1 (HIGH). It will be launch an interrupt if the pin 1 goes to level 0 (LOW).

```

Again. see also [the examples mcp_poc_interrupt01 ans mcp_poc_interrupt02](examples/) for more details. The schematic below can be used to check MCP23008 interrupt applications.


![Basic schematic for interrupt setup](extras/images/basic_schematic_interrupt.png)


## MCP23008 reset control

In most applications you can use the MC23008 reset pin directly connected to the VCC. __You can also connect the MCP23008 RESET pin to the Arduino RESET pin (It is better than previous setup)__. 
However, you might need to control the reset  via your Arduino sketch. If so, check the setup and reset functions to do that on [MCP23008 library API Documentation](https://pu2clr.github.io/MCP23008/extras/apidoc/html/).  The code below shows the RESET setup on Arduino and MCP23008.

```cpp
#include <pu2clr_mcp23008.h>

#define RESET_PIN 12  // Arduino pin 12 will be used to control the MCP23008 RESET

MCP mcp;


void setup() {

  mcp.setup(0x20, 0B00001111, RESET_PIN);  // GPIO 0 to 3 are input (buttons) and 4 to 7 are output (LEDs)
  mcp.setRegister(REG_GPPU, 0B00001111); // sets GPIO 0 to 3 with internal pull up resistors

  .
  .  
  . 
  mcp.reset();  // the setup function above already called the MCP23008 reset. But you can also call reset function if you need it in other situation

```


#### Extending the MCP class

A good way to customize the PU2CLR MCP Arduino Library for your needs is extending the current version of the library by using C++ OOP approaching.  For example: 

```cpp
#include <pu2clr_mcp23008.h>
class MyCustomMCP : public MCP { // extending the original MCP class
  public:
    // New functions / methods
    int methodA() {    // some MCP action that PU2CLR MCP Arduino Library does not implement
      return 0;
    }

    int methodB() {    // another MCP action that PU2CLR MCP Arduino Library does not implement
      return 1;
    }

    // Overwriting existent methods
    void setRegister(uint8_t reg, uint8_t value) { 
      // Here, your setRegister code that will replace the original code 

      return;
    }
}

// Now you can use the extended class

MyCustomMCP myMCP;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial);

  myMCP.methodA();
  myMCP.methodB();
  myMCP.setRegister(REG_GPIO, (myMCPgetRegister(REG_GPIO) & ~(1 << 2)) | (HIGH << 2) );

}




```
